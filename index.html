            <h2>What is Renewable Energy?</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy refers to energy that is generated from natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, geothermal heat, and more. These sources are essential for reducing the impact of climate change.</p>
            <p>The importance of renewable energy lies in its ability to reduce carbon emissions, increase energy security, and provide sustainable energy sources for future generations.</p>
